# **Wheel Loader Design with Simscape&trade;**
This repository contains models and code to help engineers model and simulate 
wheel loaders. A set of examples shows how to design a power-split hydromechanical
CVT (continuously variable transmission), test driveline designs, and determine
requirements for linkage actuators.

* **Early-stage physical design** is supported by parameterized models of
the transmission, driveline, and chassis, useful before CAD is ready
* **Design tradeoffs** are explored using optimization algorithms, which
are used to find gear ratios that achieve desired speed ranges
* **Interactive workflows** are shown using MATLAB&reg; Apps to explore designs
* **Integrated testing of physical system and controller** is supported by 
a hydromechanical model of the CVT, powertrain, and linkage.
* **Surface terrain definition** is shown by extracting point clouds from STL geometry.
* **Tire profile definition** is shown by extracting point clouds from STL geometry.
